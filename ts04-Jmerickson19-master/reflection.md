# Description
Describe your program in your own words.
This program is identical to the program in milestone 2, where it reads a text
file of possible schedules then determines if the schedule is valid. Although,
this time around it uses pointers when referring to an array of course objects
instead of just using the arrays themselves.
# Challenges encountered
Describe the challenges you encountered while creating your program.
One of the major issues I encountered while creating my program was figuring out
how to properly traverse through the array of courses when de-referencing through
pointers.
# Things I've learned
What is the most important thing you've learned from creating your program?
The most important thing I learned from creating my program is to freshen up on
core concepts that I may forget days later. Essentially, to stay familiar with
the properties of pointers and how they interact with arrays.
