# Description
Describe your program in your own words.
This program is functionally similar to the previous milestone project with the
addition of using the new ScheduleManager class and its modified member
function implementations.
# Challenges encountered
Describe the challenges you encountered while creating your program.
Challenges encountered while creating the program included figuring out how to
properly allocate and allocate best_schedule_, adjusting the timespan class
to accompany for a Tuesday/Thursday conflict, as well as figure out the properly
implementation of std::next_permutation.
# Things I've learned
What is the most important thing you've learned from creating your program?
I have learned the importance of creating variable names for readablity as well
as to double check that functions like TimeSpan cover all the possible test cases.
