# Description
Describe your program in your own words.
  This program takes a user submitted schedule and validates the input file. If the program finds an error with the schedule while validating, it will spit out an error informing the user what is wrong with their schedule (e.g not being able to find the file, the time format is incorrect, etc.) It use several functions outside of main to validate the file, schedule symbols, time format, the time submitted, and if the start time and end time is valid.
# Challenges encountered
Describe the challenges you encountered while creating your program.
  One of the major hurdles when creating the program was figuring out the appropriate structure to use. This included things like figuring the overall structure of the code, what loops to use if any, whether or not to use switch statements/if-else if chains. For me, the biggest challenge was implementing the checks for the time input as well as the schedule symbols. I was racking my brain trying to figure out how to check a valid time for XX:YY or X:YY. Time after time I would make changes to the code thinking it would finally pass the maketest cases, to no avail. Eventually, I found out that string had some member functions that could assist in validating the time.

# Things I've learned
What is the most important thing you've learned from creating your program?
  The most important thing I have learned from creating my program is that I need to get started as early as I can. I procrastinate the first few days when I should have been looking at the project ahead of time so any challenges I ran into wouldn't be effected by a lack of time to implement the proper solutions. I also learned the importance of tracing code and using example code to see where exactly the program bugs/glitches.
