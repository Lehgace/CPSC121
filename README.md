# CPSC121 Archive
An archive of all coding projects assigned during my Spring 2020 semester at CSUF. Primary programming language used is C++.

Format for each lab/project typically includes a README and LICENSE provided by the professor with instructions for project in addition to necessary working files.

Reuploaded to my main Github account from my student account; for review and nostalgia purposes.
