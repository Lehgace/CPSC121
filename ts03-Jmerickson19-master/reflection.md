# Description
Describe your program in your own words.
This program utilizes a TimeSpan class and has_conflict function to prompt the user for appointments and then checks if the appointments conflict with one another. 
# Challenges encountered
Describe the challenges you encountered while creating your program.
Part of the challenge was figuring out how to structure the has_conflict in scheduler.cpp. Initially, I started by using an if and else if statement with the overloaded operators for TimeSpan. After multiple errors, I then found out that I needed to use indented if statement chains since my initial idea did not properly address the possible cases for the appointment overlaps.
# Things I've learned
What is the most important thing you've learned from creating your program?
The most important thing I have learned from creating this program is to thoroughly think through the test cases for a given problem. I also learned how valuable it is to use a pencil and paper to visualize the code structure.
