# Description
Describe your program in your own words.
  The program is identical to the previous project milestone. It reads a file
  that contains information about a course, then validates if the course info
  is correct. This time around, it also assigns the passed info into an array
  of courses then prints that array.
# Challenges encountered
Describe the challenges you encountered while creating your program.
  The challenges I initially encountered while creating the program was figuring
  out how to migrate the validation function from main into the loader
  function. I also had difficulty perfecting the display function, as it was
  strict about how time was passed into the display function. There was also
  some difficulty encountered when implementing both the global and class
  display functions.
# Things I've learned
What is the most important thing you've learned from creating your program?
  The importance of re-reading the instructions for the 100th time in a row, as
  well as double checking/tracing your code.
