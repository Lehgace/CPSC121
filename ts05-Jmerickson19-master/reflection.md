# Description
Describe your program in your own words.
This program refactors the preexisting code from milestone 4 to the specifications listed in the readme.md. At its core, the program loads a schedule and checks if its valid using newly implemented/modified classes and member functions such as TimeSpan and the add() member function.
# Challenges encountered
Describe the challenges you encountered while creating your program.
Some challenges I encountered while creating my program was figuring out how to fix the operator overloads for comparison with the new CourseSchedule pointer array and objects. It was also a challenge to properly implement the add member function.
# Things I've learned
What is the most important thing you've learned from creating your program?
I learned that re-reading previously implemented code to familiarize yourself with how the code works is a valuable tool when understanding what do next.
