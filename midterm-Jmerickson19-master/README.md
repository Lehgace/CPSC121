# Midterm Exam Part 2: Programming
## Timing and general instructions
You have **1 hour** to complete the programming part of the midterm exam. You should not open any website other than the Titanium midterm exam page during the exam. Do not communicate with your classmates or look at their screens. Direct all questions to the instructor only.

You are allowed to view your own one page 8.5 x 11 study guide, and use paper that will be provided to you for scratch work.

You are free to use any editor and the command line on Tuffix to write, compile, and test your program. The instructors will use `clang++` to check your programs when grading them, so make sure your code works with this compiler.

Instructors and lab assistants will not answer questions regarding interpretting syntax errors or debugging code.

## Problem and points
There are three programming problems that you need to complete.

1. Quarterly Sales *(25 points)*
1. Soda Tracker *(15 points)*
1. Cat Class Fever *(10 points)*

If you get stuck on any one of the problems, it is highly recommended that you move on to the other problems before spending too much time on one problem.

# Submission
Your answers will be submitted through GitHub. You can push your code as many times as you want before the end of the midterm exam. We will check the last version that you pushed during the exam.

When you are done, verify you have pushed your code properly on GitHub. Simply refresh your GitHub repo and click on the individual files to see that they have your latest changes.

On Titanium, click on the `Add submission` button in the midterms page. Provide the URL for your GitHub repo containing the midterm exam and click on `Save changes`. Finally click on `Submit assignment`.

Before leaving the room, please approach the instructor who will verify that you submitted your exam properly. Also turn in your scratch paper and study guide to the instructor. Be sure your name and CWID are on both of those papers.

# Good luck!
